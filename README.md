## How to add it to my project?

This is a header only library. So actually, all you need is to add the libcpp-pg-pool.hpp file
in src folder to your project and start using it with #include.

But this library is uses libpqxx under the hood. So, you also need to add libpqxx to
your project before to use it.

You can find usage examples in the examples folder, also find a sample CMakeLists.txt file content below.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)

project(myProject)

find_package(libpqxx CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(myProject main.cpp libcpp-pg-pool.hpp)

target_link_libraries(myProject PRIVATE libpqxx::pqxx)

```

## How to use? (Simple Connection)

You can use the **"acquire"** method to obtain a new connection. The value returned from the acquire method
is a shared pointer and the connection is automatically returned to the pool as soon as it goes out of scope.
Therefore, you do not need to close the connection manually.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Connection Pool should be created only once in the application
> It may take up to 1 second to be ready depending on the pool size

```cpp
#include "libcpp-pg-pool.hpp"

using namespace lklibs;

int main() {

    const auto connectionString = "dbname=my_db user=my_user password=my_password host=localhost port=5432";

    // You can optionally specify the connection pool size, but if you don't, the default value will be 100
    PgPool pool(connectionString, 10);


    {
        // Acquire a connection from the pool
        const auto dbConnection = pool.acquire();

        pqxx::work txn(*dbConnection);

        const auto result = txn.exec("SELECT * FROM my_table");

        for (const auto& row : result)
        {
            std::cout << row[0].c_str() << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // Connection is automatically returned to the pool when the dbConnection goes out of scope
    // So, no need to manually close the connection

    return 0;
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The connection pool size should not exceed PostgreSQL's max_connections limit,
> otherwise you will get an error like "too many clients"

## How to use? (Shared Connection)

The return value from the acquire method is a shared pointer and counts shared references. When you open a connection
and share it with another class, even if the acquired connection object goes out of scope, it keeps the connection open
until the last shared class object is destroyed.

```cpp
#include "libcpp-pg-pool.hpp"

using namespace lklibs;

class SampleConsumer
{
public:
    void setDbConnection(std::shared_ptr<pqxx::connection> dbConnection)
    {
        this->dbConnection = std::move(dbConnection);
    }

    void queryData() const
    {
        pqxx::work txn(*dbConnection);

        const auto result = txn.exec("SELECT * FROM my_table");

        for (const auto& row : result)
        {
            std::cout << row[0].c_str() << std::endl;
        }
    }

    [[nodiscard]] bool isConnectionOpen() const
    {
        return dbConnection->is_open();
    }

private:
    std::shared_ptr<pqxx::connection> dbConnection;
};

int main() {

    const auto connectionString = "dbname=my_db user=my_user password=my_password host=localhost port=5432";

    PgPool pool(connectionString);


    {
        SampleConsumer myConsumer{};

        {
            // Acquire a connection from the pool
            const auto dbConnection = pool.acquire();

            // Connection is shared with SampleConsumer
            myConsumer.setDbConnection(dbConnection);

            myConsumer.queryData();
        }

        // Connection is still alive even after the dbConnection goes out of scope because SampleConsumer is still holding the shared_ptr

        std::cout << "Connection status:" << myConsumer.isConnectionOpen() << std::endl;
    }

    // Connection is automatically returned to the pool when all shared_ptr holding the connection go out of scope

    return 0;
```

## Semantic Versioning

Versioning of the library is done using conventional semantic versioning. Accordingly,
in the versioning made as **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**;

**PATCH:** Includes possible Bug&Fixes and improvements. You definitely want to get this.

**MINOR:** Additional functionality added via backwards compatibility. You probably want to
get this, it doesn't hurt.

**MAJOR:** Additional functionality that breaks backwards compatibility. You'll need to know
what's changed before you get it, and you'll probably have to make changes to your own code.
If I publish something like this, I will definitely add the changes required for migration
section to the documentation.

## Full function list

You can find the complete list of functions in the library below.

> [!TIP]
> All functions and parameters descriptions are also available within the code as comment for IDEs.
